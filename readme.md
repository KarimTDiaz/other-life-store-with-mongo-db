## Description

Portable Stereo App is an online music streaming application in which you can create and edit mixtapes (playlists) save favorite songs, create and edit the user as well as play the saved songs.

## What have I learned in this project?

This project is the most ambitious and hardest project I have ever faced. In this project I learned to manage users with Firebase while managing the database in MongoDB and the files stored in FireStorage, you have to take into account when testing the application that Google's free services are limited and can collapse the app if too many requests are made.

I have learned to manage the back-end to request and return the necessary data and print them in an appropriate way on the front-end. I learned how to manage the user data continuously, thanks to Socket.IO which is able to maintain an open channel with the server to receive continuous response to changes, in the Mongo database.

I have learned to restrict routes of the app depending on whether there is a registered user using a provider and a context to be able to use the user data anywhere in the application. And for the development of the audio player I have used an external custom hook.

I have also learned to manage a custom hook which i used to requests to the database in addition to managing its asynchronous state so that if it fails or is loading, the application does not fail.

To all this it should be said that the code can be cleaned and structured in a better way, but after a month of work for the development of the application, I will start a new one and try to write more organized from the beginning. Also I would like to add the function to save the progress of the song and its variables such as volume and time of playback, but due to the limitations of firestore it is not possible.
